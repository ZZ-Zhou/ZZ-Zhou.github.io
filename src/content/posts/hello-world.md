Every journal needs a first entry.

This is mine. A space for thinking out loud — about transportation systems, AI and its limits, the odd beauty of mathematics, and whatever else occupies my attention on any given week.

Expect posts on:

- **Research & work** — modeling mobility, transit analysis, demand forecasting, and the messy reality of applying theory to practice.
- **Ideas** — operations research, machine learning, systems thinking, and where they overlap.
- **Everything else** — books, films, Go (Weiqi), travel, and the things that don't fit a category.

Posts will arrive when they're ready, not on a schedule. Quality over frequency.

Welcome.
